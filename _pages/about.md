Welcome! I am  currently a third-year Ph.D. student at [Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)](http://www.ict.ac.cn/), also with the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/), advised by [Prof. Dongrui Fan](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~fandongrui) and [Prof. Wenming Li](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~liwenming). Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the School of Microelectronics, [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/). My research interests include dataflow-driven AI chip design, reconfigurable computing, digital computing-in-memory architecture, and hardware-software co-design. Please feel free to contact me.

## Research Experiences

My research focuses on **Hardware-Software Co-Design of Dataflow-Driven Execution Model for Emerging AI Applications**, with the following directions:
* ***Dataflow-Driven Data Prefetching***
* ***Dataflow-Driven Task Scheduling***
* ***Dataflow-Driven In-Memory Computing***

I aim to optimize dataflow-driven data prefetching, task scheduling, in-memory computing, and RISC-V extension via **Algorithm-Architecture-Circuit Co-Design** for emerging AI, cryptography, and graph applications, particularly in accelerating sparse scenarios.
