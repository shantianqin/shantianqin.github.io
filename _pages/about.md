Welcome! I am a second-year M.S. student at [Institute of Computing Technology (ICT)](http://www.ict.ac.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), also with the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/), advised by [Prof. Dongrui Fan](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~fandongrui)). Before joining ICT, I obtained a bachelor's degree from the [School of Microelectronics](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), [Tongji University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). My research interests mainly lie in reconfigurable dataflow architecture, computing-in-memory architecture, parallel scheduling, and hardware-software co-design.
